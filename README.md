# Show-and-Tell-A-Neural-Image-Caption-Generator-pytorch



## getting started
This repository is a pytorch implementation of [Show-and-Tell-A-Neural-Image-Caption-Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555v2.pdf) for Image Captioning. 













## encoder : resnet50
I used resnet50 as an encoder. Larger cnn models such as efficientnet and resnet152 could have been used, but in this project, encoders were not included in the trainable params, so I chose smaller models.
